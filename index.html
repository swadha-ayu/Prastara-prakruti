    <h1>Prana Ayurveda - Prakruti Assessment</h1>
    <p>
As we do prakruti parikshana , a more refined concept to analyse the dominance of doshas at different levels , "Prastara Prakruti." 
Prakruti denotes that the idea is taken from the concept of prakriti pariksha mentioned in Charaka samhita , and Prastara means the dimensions.  
<p> 
Here , we will assess the doshik Prakruti on each Prastara ( dimension) , providing  a simpler application of prakruti assessment in identifying risk factors and prevention of diseases. Each text in option provides the criteria to be assessed by the person. The image associated tells the risks and preventive measures for that dimension.
