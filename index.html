    <h1>Prana Ayurveda - Prakruti Assessment</h1>
    <p>
As we do prakruti parikshana , a more refined concept <br> to analyse the dominance of doshas at different levels , <br> "Prastara Prakruti." </p> 
<p> 
Prakruti denotes that the idea is taken from the concept of prakriti pariksha <br> mentioned in Charaka samhita , and Prastara means the dimensions.  
</p> 
<p> 
Here , we will assess the doshik Prakruti on each Prastara ( dimension) , <br> providing  a simpler application of prakruti assessment <br> in identifying risk factors and prevention of diseases. 
</p>
<p> 
Each text in option provides the criteria to be assessed by the person. <br> The image associated tells the risks and <br> preventive measures for that dimension. 
</p>
<p style="color:#5c4033;">
 Select the option that matches maximum to your personality.
